# DaverAgent — Global opencode Configuration

This repository **is** the global configuration of the opencode agent system
(delivery, orchestrator, coder, tester, …). Clone it into `~/.config/opencode`
(or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode`) and every project on the machine shares the
same agents.

- **One copy per machine.** No per-project `.opencode/` copies, no duplicated
  agent prompts.
- **Global config, per-project docs.** The agent system lives here; project
  facts live in each project's `docs/` and are resolved per session.
- **Portable.** The install is a git clone; no absolute paths are hardcoded.
  Machine-specific paths (e.g. an MCP server binary) must be provided through a
  gitignored `opencode.local.json` override, never committed here.

## Install (per machine)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DaveR-ui/DaverAgent.git ~/.config/opencode
```

There is no separate install step: opencode reads the config directly from the
clone. Update with `git pull` in the clone and validate with
`bash scripts/validate-agent.sh`.

## Path contract

Two path vocabularies coexist. The normative resolution rule is the
`references.agent-system.description` in `opencode.json` (opencode injects that
reference's absolute root into every agent's context).

| Vocabulary | Examples | Resolves against |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent-system assets** | `agents/`, `protocols/`, `code-lang/`, `scripts/` | The `agent-system` reference in `opencode.json` |
| **Project documents** | `docs/project.md`, `docs/context/**` | The session working directory (each project's repo) |

This repo deliberately declares **no** `instructions` key. On opencode V2
`instructions` is a documented no-op — accepted but **not loaded** — and V2's
only ambient instruction source is `AGENTS.md`, which this repo deliberately
does not ship. Project docs are therefore read **on demand** from explicit
paths. A project that wants explicit `docs/context` / `docs/protocols`
references declares them in its own `opencode.json` `references` block.

**Golden rule:** never create a global `docs/`, and never hardcode an absolute
path. The read tool does not expand `~`.

## Available agents

Defined in `agents/<id>.md` (`subagent` mode, except `delivery` which is
`primary`). Invoked from `delivery` or `orchestrator` via the subagent tool.

This table owns the **purposes** (all agents, including `delivery`, `orchestrator`
and `interpreter`). The dispatch contract — structured returns and the
model-independence dispatch rule — is the authoritative table in
`agents/orchestrator.md` → `## Available Subagents`; it is not duplicated here.

| Agent | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `delivery` | Interface with the human. Does NOT delegate technical work to itself. |
| `orchestrator` | Executes Phase 2 (Reduce), coordinates multi-step work, fans out subagents. |
| `coder` | Implementation (`language=angular|go`). Returns `CoderOutput`. |
| `tester` | Tests (`framework=vitest|karma-jasmine|playwright|go`). Returns `TesterOutput`. |
| `reviewer` | Code review, security, performance. Returns `ReviewerOutput`. |
| `architect` | Design, boundaries, patterns. Returns `ArchitectOutput`. |
| `analista` | Second opinion, plan critique, stuck-recovery. Returns `AnalystOutput`. |
| `explorer` | Search and mapping in the repo. Returns `ExplorerOutput`. |
| `external-scout` | Brings docs of external libraries via webfetch. |
| `interpreter` | Normalizes the prompt (Step 0) and inspects a single image. |
| `documenter` | Writes/maintains `docs/`. Returns `DocumenterOutput`. |

Model lives in **each agent's frontmatter**
(`agents/<id>.md`). Changing a model = editing the agent's frontmatter and
restarting opencode. Without a declared `model:`, a subagent inherits the model
of the primary agent that invokes it. `opencode.json` carries the built-in
`agents.title.model` slot (title generation, and — by orchestrator convention —
the cheap, different-family slot read at dispatch time for `reviewer`/`analista`
and every Typed-Decision Panel panelist). The orchestrator dispatches those seats
with the model configured at `agents.title.model`, a different model family from
the primary, so the independent second opinions stay independent. Invariant: that
slot must stay cheap and from a *different model family* than the primary — if it
is pointed at a same-family model, the second opinions silently degrade to a
monoculture.

## Protocols

The protocols live in `protocols/`:

- [`prompt-pipeline.md`](./protocols/prompt-pipeline.md) — Step 0 (Interpret) is
  executed by the `interpreter`; Phase 2 (Reduce) is executed by the
  `orchestrator`.
- [`dispatch.md`](./protocols/dispatch.md) — turn-entry procedure for the
  `delivery` seat: the interpreter-first gate, the "about to ask" tripwire, and
  the hand-off into the pipeline.
- [`orchestrate.md`](./protocols/orchestrate.md) — pre-action thinking process for
  the `orchestrator` seat: Protocol Discovery → Context Refresh → Proposal →
  Implementation → Verification → Documentation.
- [`subagent-spec-template.md`](./protocols/subagent-spec-template.md) — canonical
  shape for subagent definitions.
- [`subagent-return-check.md`](./protocols/subagent-return-check.md) — shared manual
  return assessment, optional checker, and bounded schema repair (not a runtime hook).
- [`session-recovery.md`](./protocols/session-recovery.md) — recovery flow for
  interrupted or STUCK sessions in the delivery → orchestrator → subagent
  hierarchy.
- [`broad-investigation-template.md`](./protocols/broad-investigation-template.md) —
  5-section scaffold for prompts that map, inventory, or audit the repo.

## Coding standards

Standards live in `code-lang/` and are loaded on demand by
[`coder`](./agents/coder.md):

- [`default/standards.md`](./code-lang/default/standards.md) — language-agnostic
  architectural principles, not a list of supported languages.
- [`angular/standards.md`](./code-lang/angular/standards.md) — Angular-specific
  guidance and canonical references.
- [`go/standards.md`](./code-lang/go/standards.md) — maintainer placeholder;
  contains no Go guidance.

## Agent permissions

- Global runtime permission rules live in `opencode.json` as the top-level
  `permissions` array of `{ action, resource, effect }`. Each agent also carries
  its own `permission:` block in its `.md` frontmatter. Valid V2 permission
  actions include `read`, `edit`, `glob`, `grep`, `list`, `bash`, `task`,
  `webfetch`, `websearch`, `question`, `external_directory`, `lsp`, `skill`, and
  `doom_loop`; `task` is the subagent-dispatch gate. `webfetch`/`websearch` are
  first-class V2 actions — verified against the installed runtime — so
  `external-scout`'s `webfetch: allow` and `delivery`'s `webfetch: deny` are
  legitimate rules, not leftovers.
- **Two permission vocabularies.** The top-level `permissions` array in
  `opencode.json` uses the runtime's action names verbatim — notably `shell` for
  shell execution (the shell tool asserts `action: "shell"`), `edit` for
  edit/write/patch, and `subagent` for dispatch. Each agent's `permission:`
  block in its `.md` frontmatter uses the agent-config keys (`bash`, `task`,
  `edit`, `read`, …), which the runtime aliases to `shell` / `subagent` /
  `edit`. Do NOT rename `shell` → `bash` in the global array: that turns the
  shell rules inert, because the evaluated action is `shell`. Verified against
  the installed runtime v2.0.8.
- Self `permission.task` grants remain on `explorer` and `reviewer` only — the
  two agents whose bodies document self fan-out (`## Sampling and Fan-out`).
  Every other subagent does not recurse and carries no `task` grant.
- `orchestrator` and the subagents have no external skills pre-enabled. Any
  built-in skills come from the opencode runtime itself, not from this repo (the
  runtime owns the skill names, which may change). **This repo ships no skills by
  design**: operating conventions are `protocols/*.md` and coding standards are
  `code-lang/**/standards.md` — intentionally prose markdown, not
  `.opencode/skills/`, because skills are strict-text and protocols are the
  preferred mechanism here.
- All project info lives in each project's `docs/context/` and is read **on
  demand**.
- **Structured returns are a prose contract, not runtime-enforced.** The V2
  `output_schema` behavior is specified in
  [`protocols/subagent-spec-template.md`](./protocols/subagent-spec-template.md)
  (the SSOT), and `scripts/validate-agent.sh` performs the structural check on
  `agents/*.schema.json`.
- **`delivery`, `orchestrator`, and `external-scout` are prose-only contracts by
  design** — no `output_schema` is intended for them. `delivery` and `orchestrator`
  do carry a typed **coordination envelope** on the two hops between them (`status`
  / `files_changed` / `subagent_outcomes` around the markdown report), defined in
  `agents/orchestrator.md` → `## Handoff Protocol`; the envelope is a convention,
  not an `output_schema`, so the prose-only statement still holds.

## Updating the config

- **Change an agent's model** → edit the frontmatter of `agents/<id>.md`
  (`model`), then restart opencode.
- **Change an agent's definition** (prompt, tools, permissions, schema) → edit
  `agents/<id>.md`.
- **Add an agent** → create `agents/<id>.md`. Required frontmatter: `description`
  and `mode`. Optional frontmatter: `model`, `permission`,
  `output_schema` — without a declared `model:`, the subagent inherits the
  invoking primary's model (see "Available agents" above). Then:
  - grant the new agent in `permission.task` in the delegating agents
    (`agents/delivery.md` / `agents/orchestrator.md`) — otherwise the new agent
    is never reachable;
  - if you declare `output_schema: ./<id>.schema.json`, also create the sibling
    `agents/<id>.schema.json`.
  Do not add a per-agent block to `opencode.json`; it carries only the built-in
  `agents.title.model` slot, and per-agent `model` stays in each
  agent's frontmatter.
- **Update the global install** → `git pull` in the `~/.config/opencode` clone.

## Validating the config

Before committing changes to the agent system, run the single integrity gate:

```bash
bash scripts/validate-agent.sh
```

It is exit-code driven (CI-ready) and checks:

- `opencode.json` is valid JSON;
- the flat `agents/` layout is intact, with frontmatter and a valid `mode` on every agent;
- unsupported fields are absent: no `instructions`, no `small_model`, no singular `agent` block;
- no `AGENTS.md` is shipped;
- no secret material is committed;
- secret-like filenames are checked in the Git index (tracked/staged NUL paths),
  not ignored/untracked runtime state; `.env.example` templates remain allowed;
- every `output_schema` resolves to an existing file;
- `permission.task` grants fail closed (every allow target resolves to a real agent);
- every `references` entry resolves;
- every `*.schema.json` under `agents/` parses as valid JSON and is structurally
  closed (any `scripts/*.schema.json` is included when present; this repo
  currently ships none);
- every schema enum target (e.g. `re_route_to`) resolves to an agent;
- no dangling references: markdown links plus inline-code agent-system Markdown
  paths resolve across `agents/`, `protocols/`, and recursively scanned
  `code-lang/`, including relative Markdown references inside `code-lang/`.
- checker unit tests and schema-agent Structured Return JSON examples pass.

### Optional child-return checker

Resolve `AGENT_SYSTEM_ROOT` at execution time from the injected `agent-system`
reference; do not commit a machine-specific absolute path. Pipe the **existing
in-memory child return** using the current shell's ordinary stdin piping (no
scratch file). For example, with `child_return` already holding the return in Bash:

```bash
printf '%s' "$child_return" | python3 "$AGENT_SYSTEM_ROOT/scripts/check-subagent-return.py" --agent coder
python3 "$AGENT_SYSTEM_ROOT/scripts/check-subagent-return.py" --check-examples
python3 "$AGENT_SYSTEM_ROOT/scripts/test_check_subagent_return.py"
```

Use an available Python interpreter for the optional checker. The integrity script
execution-probes `python3`, then `python`, requiring Python 3. To choose explicitly,
set `PYTHON` to an interpreter executable (not a command with arguments); an invalid
explicit override fails loudly without fallback. No installation or shim is needed.
Exit 0 is valid shape, 1 invalid, 2 cannot verify (including
distinct `no_schema` for intentional prose contracts). Diagnostics are bounded JSON
on stdout without raw child data. No schema references or unsupported assertions
are silently accepted. The shared protocol owns manual fallback, truthful reporting,
the one-repair-per-child cap, and STUCK/NEEDS_HUMAN routing. Shape validity is not
semantic approval or a Confidence Gate result; no automatic runtime gate is added.

## Troubleshooting

**"My config is not picked up"** — Verify `opencode.json` is valid JSON:
`python3 -m json.tool opencode.json`.

**"I want to go back to the previous version"** — Use your own version control
(Git) to check out the previous state of the clone.

**"A project doesn't see its `docs/`"** — Expected: this repo declares no
`instructions` key. See "Path contract" above.
